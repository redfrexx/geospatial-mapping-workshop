# Participatory Mapping

If you want to map information related to human perception instead of physical objects, the participatory mapping might be a suitable method for your research. 

We have used it to map flood risk perception, heat stress perception, and disaster risk perception. See here for use cases. 

HeiGIT has developed a tools for this: The SketchMap tool, that makes it easy to mark areas on a paper map and then automatically digitize the marked areas to that it can be visualised and analyzed and compared to other data sets in QGIS.
