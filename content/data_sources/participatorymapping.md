# Participatory Mapping

If you want to map information related to human perception instead of physical objects, the participatory mapping might be a suitable method for your research. At our GIScience Research Group and HeiGIT, we have developed the SketchMap Tool to facilitate participatory mapping activities. The SketchMap tool makes it easy to mark areas on a paper map and then automatically digitize the marked areas to that it can be visualised and analyzed and compared to other data sets in QGIS. 

Go to [https://sketch-map-tool.heigit.org/](https://sketch-map-tool.heigit.org/) to try it out!

We have used it to map flood risk perception, heat stress perception, and disaster risk perception. Check out the [SketchMap Tool Use Cases](https://sketch-map-tool.heigit.org/en/case-studies)
