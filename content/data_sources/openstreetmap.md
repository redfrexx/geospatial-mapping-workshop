# OpenStreetMap 

[OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org) is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. It is often used as a basemap in GIS projects, but you can also download specific features (e.g. roads, buildings, land use) and use them as data layers in your maps.

Explore the OSM Wiki to find out what kinds of objects are mapped in OSM and how they are tagged: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features

Just remember: **the data is created by volunteers - similar to Wikipedia - so double check if it is accurate and complete.** For some objects you can get quality estimates using the ohsome dashboard: https://ohsome.org/dashboard/
